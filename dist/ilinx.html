            Ilinx is an online experiment that explores the relationship between computation and humans as a phenomenal world extending the existential search for knowledge.<br><br>
            The research around the project was done through reading, writing and re-editing of texts and software, theory and fiction.
            These formed a collection of materials to be interconnected with each other,  creating a map and navigating through it as the work progressed.<br><br>
            The result is an explorable diary and labyrinth where humans and machines, texts and codes melt togheter taking the shape of an hypertextual theory-fiction.
